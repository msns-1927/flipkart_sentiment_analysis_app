   Trained and compared multiple machine learning models and selected the best-performing one based on F1-score to ensure balanced performance.

- **Consistency between training and deployment:**
   Ensured the same preprocessing steps and TF-IDF vectorizer were used during both model training and real-time prediction.

- **Real-time sentiment prediction:**
   Integrated the trained model into a Streamlit web application to provide instant sentiment predictions for user-provided reviews.

- **Deployment on cloud infrastructure:**
   Successfully deployed the application on AWS EC2, addressing challenges related to environment setup, dependency management, and network access.

**📂 Dataset Description :**

The dataset consists of 8,518 customer reviews collected from Flipkart product listings. Each record represents a user’s review along with associated metadata such as rating, review text, and engagement metrics. The dataset is used to perform sentiment analysis by classifying customer opinions as positive or negative.

**🧾 Dataset Structure :**

The dataset contains 8 columns, described below:

Column Name	Description
Reviewer Name	Name or identifier of the customer who posted the review
Review Title	Short summary or heading of the review
Place of Review	Location of the reviewer (if available)
Up Votes	Number of users who found the review helpful
Down Votes	Number of users who disliked the review
Month	Month and year when the review was posted
Review text	Full textual content of the customer review
Ratings	Product rating given by the user (1 to 5 scale)


**🧠 Usage in This Project :**

- The Review text column is used as the primary input for sentiment analysis.

- The Ratings column is used to generate sentiment labels:

  - Ratings ≥ 4 → Positive sentiment

  - Ratings ≤ 2 → Negative sentiment

  - Neutral ratings (3) are excluded to improve classification clarity.

- Other metadata columns provide contextual information but are not directly used for model training.

**⚠️ Data Characteristics :**

- The dataset contains real-world noisy text, including spelling variations, punctuation, emojis, and extra phrases such as “READ MORE”.

- Some fields contain missing values, which were handled during preprocessing.

- Reviews vary in length, making text preprocessing essential before modeling.

**🎯 Purpose of the Dataset :**

This dataset enables the development of a machine learning–based sentiment analysis system that can automatically interpret customer feedback and classify product reviews as positive or negative, supporting data-driven decision-making for e-commerce platforms.

--------------------

**🛠️ Methodology :**

The project follows a systematic, end-to-end machine learning workflow to perform sentiment analysis on Flipkart product reviews.

**1️⃣ Data Collection :**

The dataset consists of customer reviews collected from Flipkart, including review text and corresponding ratings. These ratings serve as the basis for deriving sentiment labels.

**2️⃣ Data Preprocessing :**

Raw review text was cleaned to remove noise and inconsistencies. This included:

- Converting text to lowercase

- Removing URLs, punctuation, and special characters

- Eliminating irrelevant phrases such as “READ MORE”

- Removing stopwords and applying lemmatization

This step ensures that only meaningful textual information is retained for analysis.

**3️⃣ Sentiment Labeling :**

Sentiment labels were generated from product ratings:

- Ratings 4 and 5 were labeled as Positive

- Ratings 1 and 2 were labeled as Negative

- Neutral reviews (rating 3) were excluded to improve classification clarity

**4️⃣ Feature Extraction :**

The cleaned review text was transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, which captures the importance of words while reducing the influence of commonly occurring terms.

**5️⃣ Model Training and Evaluation :**

Multiple machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including:

- Logistic Regression

- Naive Bayes

- Support Vector Machine

- Random Forest

Models were compared using evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score, and the best-performing model was selected based on F1-score.

**6️⃣ Model Selection and Saving :**

The final selected model and the trained TF-IDF vectorizer were saved using joblib to ensure consistency between training and deployment environments.

**7️⃣ Application Development :**

A Streamlit web application was developed to provide a user-friendly interface where users can input product reviews and receive real-time sentiment predictions.

**8️⃣ Deployment :**

The application was deployed on AWS EC2 using a Python virtual environment. Necessary dependencies were installed, security group rules were configured, and the application was made accessible via the instance’s public IP address.

**✅ Outcome :**

This methodology ensures a reliable, scalable, and deployment-ready sentiment analysis system that processes real-world review data and delivers accurate sentiment predictions in real time.

--------------------

**🔍 Observations :**

- Customer reviews contain highly unstructured and noisy text, making preprocessing an essential step for effective sentiment analysis.

- Reviews with higher ratings (4–5) predominantly express positive sentiment, while lower ratings (1–2) clearly indicate dissatisfaction, validating the use of ratings for sentiment labeling.

- TF-IDF vectorization proved effective in capturing important words and reducing the impact of commonly occurring terms.

- Among the evaluated machine learning models, Random Forest achieved the best performance based on F1-score, indicating a good balance between precision and recall.

- Excluding neutral reviews (rating 3) improved model clarity and reduced ambiguity during classification.

- The deployed Streamlit application provided real-time sentiment predictions, demonstrating the practical usability of the trained model.

- Cloud deployment on AWS EC2 confirmed that the model performs consistently outside the local development environment.

--------------------

**⚠️ Limitations :**

- The model performs binary sentiment classification (Positive/Negative) and does not handle neutral or mixed sentiments.

- Sentiment labels are derived from ratings, which may not always perfectly reflect the actual sentiment expressed in the review text.

- The model relies on traditional ML with TF-IDF and may not capture deeper contextual meaning, sarcasm, or implicit sentiment.

- Performance may vary for very short reviews or reviews containing slang, emojis, or spelling errors.

- The system is trained on Flipkart-specific data, so performance on reviews from other platforms may require retraining.

- The deployed application does not currently support batch predictions or multilingual reviews.

--------------------

**🚀 Future Improvements :**

- Extend the system to support multi-class sentiment classification, including neutral and mixed sentiments.

- Incorporate deep learning models such as LSTM, BERT, or other transformer-based architectures to capture contextual meaning and sarcasm.

- Add multilingual support to analyze reviews written in different languages.

- Enable batch sentiment analysis for processing large volumes of reviews simultaneously.

- Improve preprocessing to better handle emojis, slang, and informal language commonly used in customer reviews.

- Integrate a database or dashboard to store predictions and visualize sentiment trends over time.

- Deploy the application using Docker and CI/CD pipelines for improved scalability and maintainability.
